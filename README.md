## TSP-GA:

**Generic Algorithm**
In TSP problem first we use generic algorithm to solve it...
in TSP-GA file I implante a simple generic algorithm for solving TSP problem for 10 city!
you can edit source code for more or less cities.

## TSP-HC:

**Hill-Climbing Algorithm**
Second, I solve it with Hill-Climbing Algorithm...
in TSP-HC file I implante a simple HC algorithm for solving TSP problem again :D!


__I hope you all enjoy__
